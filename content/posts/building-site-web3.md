#  Building a static website on Web3.0

When I decided to build this website I spend a good couple of hours learning the basics how to build, deploy and host a website for free.

Here is how I did it.

- Site Generator : [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- Code editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Version control: [Github](https://github.com/)
- Hosting: [fleek](https://fleek.co/) or [ipfs link](ipfs://bafybeicr7zb3bu6ub4ja5gcn45wkfl6ir7dkfrcpdfclnod4epxeegwis4/)
- Backup: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) or [ipfs link](ipns://ipfs.io/)
- Browser: [Brave](https://brave.com/)
