This  blog is my first attempt to be part of the new `Web3.0`.
The goal is to educate and learn more about technology and crypto's world.

The main topics i will focus are: 

## WEB3.0

I will try to answer question like:

- What is the WEB3.0 and why does it matters?
- What is [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) ?
- How to deploy your website on the Web3.0?

## CRYPTO

I will share my view about Blockchain tech but also about some Crypto Coins like, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Monero.

## PRIVACY

Privacy is one of the main concerns I have on today's always-connected world.
I will cover topics such as Password management, verify Signatures and encryption, VPNs, eMail providers, data storage, but also Social Presence and Online Anon.

## TOOLS

The tools I am using to create contents and manage my social life plus any hardware if that is the case.
Whenever possible I am going to use [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) (Free and Open Source Software)
